# FindTheValue Game with java
## This is a java program that can guess user's picked number with 100% accuracy.
# How the game works?
## The user is asked to pick a number in their heads and then the program shows the user a series of decks and what user has to do is to tell which deck does their picked number exist (this process happens some amount of times). The user can programmatically change the number of options and\or repetions they want to happen. The default values are set to 3 options and 3 repeats and what that means is the program would show 3 options to the user repeating that process 3 times and after that the program would guess the number. The program decides the range of numbers the user have to pick depending options and repeats. default is from 1 to 27.
